#### List of original files

 - 'README.txt': describes about the general information and background related to the data sets within the zip file.
	
 	 - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

   	 - 'features.txt': List of all features.

   	 - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

   	 - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

   	 - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

   	 - 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

   	 - 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
   
    	 - 'train/subject_train.txt':   Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
            Its range is from 1 to 30. (for training set)
   
  	 - 'test/subject_test.txt':  Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
  	    Its range is from 1 to 30. (for test set)
      
   	  The following data sets are not been used in the current project. 

   	 - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt'; 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt';

  ####My work
  

There are mainly five steps in run_analysis. R

Step-1: Read data from test and training samples and merge the samples according to variables name using cbind() and rbind()

Step-2: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using grepl()

Step-3: Read activity_lables file and merge the lables to the dataset to name the activities

Step-4: Clean variable names using gsub() using gsub to delete unnecessary symbols

Step-5: Create a second dataset with the average of each variable for each activity
