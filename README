Project Purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

Project Data Resources:

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Script Description:

There are mainly five steps in run_analysis. R

Step-1: Read data from test and training samples and merge the samples according to variables name using cbind() and rbind()

Step-2: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using grepl()

Step-3: Read activity_lables file and merge the lables to the dataset to name the activities

Step-4: Clean variable names using gsub() using gsub to delete unnecessary symbols

Step-5: Create a second dataset with the average of each variable for each activity
